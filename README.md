## About me

I am a positive thinker who possesses two sides of power. On the one hand, I'm organized, structured, and detail-oriented because I'm a software engineering student. On the other hand, due to my character, I like to make projects ideal or close to ideal.

I received my bachelor's degree from the University and was involved in the development of a couple of small video game projects. The scope of my responsibilities was project testing, which involved testing project iterations.

Now I want to use my research and analytical skills in software testing. I am now intensively learning techniques and tools by taking online courses and testing web applications built for educational purposes.

I will be very happy to apply the knowledge gained to test a working product and gain practical experience. This is an important step in my current career goal of becoming a software tester.
